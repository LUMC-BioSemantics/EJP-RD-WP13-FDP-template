# EJP-RD WP19 FDP template
## Introduction
This template is made to simplify the collection of metadata attributes of datasets and their distributions. By exporting csv, and adding this to Github repositories, advantage is taken of the version control capabilities of Git and Github.
## Step 1: Preparation
### Download template
Download the template.xlsx file from this repository. This template works best with Microsoft Excel, but also works with LibreOffice.
When creating new metadata, this template can be used immediately. When editing existing metadata, the existing csv files should be pasted into the template.
## Step 2: Datasets
### Dataset sheet
The first sheet of the template contains metadata of the datasets.
## Step 3: Distributions
### Distribution sheet
The second sheet of the template contains metadata of the distributions
## Step 4: Export
### Set up excel
In excel, in some localizations, it is necessary to set the decimal separator to "." and the thousands separator to ",". This can be done in the File->Options->Advanced>Editin options menu.
### Export csv
The Individual sheets can be exported with File->Export->Change File Type->CSV (Comma delimited) (*.csv)
